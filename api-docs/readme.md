# nrelay docs
This website provides documentation for the source code of nrelay.
[The main nrelay repository](https://github.com/thomas-crane/nrelay/blob/master/docs/readme.md) has further documentation in the form of guides and tutorials about using nrelay.

This website is generated using the [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/) documentation generator.
It uses the inline JSDoc comments that are written in the nrelay source, so it is simply a more readable version of the documentation which can be found in the code.

Some of the notable classes which are used commonly by plugins include:

+ [Client](https://docs.nrelay.net/classes/client.html)
+ [Runtime](https://docs.nrelay.net/classes/runtime.html)
+ [PlayerTracker](https://docs.nrelay.net/classes/playertracker.html)

If you are looking for a specific interface or class, the best way to find it is to use the search bar at the top of this page.
